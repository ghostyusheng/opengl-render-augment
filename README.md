The paper explores real-time non-photorealistic rendering, particularly simulating a hand-drawn sketch effect in OpenGL.
 The key techniques include:
Edge detection using a Sobel filter to extract contours,


Hatching shaders to simulate pencil strokes,


And tone mapping to imitate the texture and feel of a sketch.


These methods are all about achieving a natural pencil-drawing look without sacrificing performance—useful in games and stylized animations.
